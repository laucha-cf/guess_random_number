Choose, you wanna be the guest or host? I mean, do you wanna try to guess the computer number? or...
Do you want the computer to guess your number?
First of all, choose a number that is going to be the top of interval to play.
Example...I choose 48, so the random number will be between 1 and 48.
Then just try to guess the random number or let the computer guess it. HAVE FUN!!
